                I know what you’re thinking, there’s a bird blocking the sun.
                Well I know. I could’ve taken one without the bird but you see
                this photo would be so much more difficult to replicate that to
                me it's a perfect picture and I love it. Anyways, hello everyone
                my name is Gregorio Barbosa but most people call me Greg. I’m a
                first generation Mexican-American (Both parents are from
                Jalisco, Mexico) born in Joliet, Illinois in 1995. Thank you for
                taking the time and looking at my website. I hope you enjoy
                learning a bit more about me and if you haven’t also check out
                my work and education section.
              </p>

                As I mentioned, I was born in Joliet, Illinois and lived there
                until I was around 6 years old, after that we moved to Berwyn,IL
                and eventually to Cicero, IL where I currently have spent most
                of my life so far. Since we moved around a bit I went to a total
                of about 13 different schools in my lifetime so I'm very used to
                being in a new environment and meeting new people.
              </p>

                Growing up outside of school, I loved watching and playing
                soccer. Whether it was with my friends at the park or playing
                with a team. I actually liked it so much that when I was in
                community college I did coaching for a U16 team and got to
                experience the sport in a different way. Now in days pre covid I
                was still playing and hope to continue playing post pandemic.

                Another big part of my life is technology, I have always loved
                tech since as long as I can remember. When I was around 10 years
                old I remember taking apart electronics just to see what is
                inside of them, sadly those toys would never be put back
                together. I always knew that I wanted to do something with
                technology which throughout my career you can see I did just
                that, working at Best Buy to see the latest tech products,
                working IT, and where I am today as an Application Developer
                making this website. I’m very happy and passionate with what I
                do.

                As I look into the future, I want to do a lot more traveling. I
                have visited a couple of cities in the United States, Mexico,
                and Canada. Let me tell you there is a lot to see out there and
                just seeing how other people live inspires me and gives me
                ideas. Once the pandemic is over I will focus on travelling more
                overseas and experience that feeling of culture shock that I
                love so much.
              </p>

                For now and forever I will continue to learn and create new
                projects that I can share to the world, and I want to thank
                everyone who has helped me get to where I am today and thanks to
                everyone who read through this snippet of my life and down below
                are some of my favorite brands and franchises. If you want to
