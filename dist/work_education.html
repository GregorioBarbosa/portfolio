              UIC was the stepping stone to complete my dream in becoming a
              software developer and becoming the first in my family to receive
              a bachelor's degree. With my handy Dell XPS by my side, I was able
              to learn the fundamentals of Computer Science such as data
              structures and algorithms. I made a lot of friends and memories at
              UIC and would recommend this school to everyone!

              While attending UIC I worked part-time as an on-site support
              technician. This would involve going through a ticket queue of
              staff who were experiencing technical issues and going out and
              resolving those issues. This included but was not limited to VPN
              issues, onboarding setups, software installs, printer installs,
              and my favorite, Outlook issues.

              After working as Inventory Specialist I was promoted to Consultant

              any questions regarding a product we sold. I would also consult
              customers in 1 on 1 sessions for any issues they were facing on
              their devices. Lastly, I would offer and sell Geek Squad’s tech
              support service. I still have my badge to this day , Agent 105349.

              I started working at Best Buy in the store’s warehouse where I

              set up planograms, change price tags and signage, assist customers
              load products onto their vehicle, ensure products were secured to
              minimize store shrink, and was the backup Asset Protection and
              Custodian. Loading fridges into people’s cars was not fun.

              After high school I decided to go to community college to take my
              general education courses and have more time to decide what school
              I wanted to pursue my bachelors degree. It was also a great way to
              save money and to anyone who has doubts on the quality of
              education you’ll receive at a community college, no matter where
              you go, you get what you put in. Also, the cheesy garlic bread is
              really good here.

              This was my first job. I always loved going to malls and working
              in one seemed like a great fit and it was. At the age of 17, I
              learned the value of what it means to work for your money, I was
              finally able to buy those Brisk iced teas and Gatorades at school.
              As a Sales Associate my job was to assist, ring out customers, and
              maintain the store’s presentation. This is where I met my first
              set of Karens.

              Ah yes high school. Good times. For those of you who are still in
              high school, slow down, you’ll be an adult the rest of your life.
              Enjoy the moment you’re in and make lots of friends, you never
              know who you will meet.
